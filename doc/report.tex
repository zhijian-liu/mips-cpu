\section{Introduction}
This report is a detailed summary on the final project of the "Computer System" course. In this project, I implemented a toy CPU (I call it \texttt{mips-cpu}) with five-stage MIPS pipeline. The project has the following features:
\begin{itemize}
\item
It supports almost all of the MIPS standard integer instructions (except those related to the coprocessors).
\item
It supports full bypassing in order to mitigate the data hazards.
\end{itemize}
The project is written in Verilog HDL and is available under the open-source MIT License at \url{https://github.com/zhijian-liu/mips-cpu}.

\section{Main Modules}

\subsection{Stage Modules}
In the five-stage MIPS pipeline, there are obviously five separate pipeline stages:
\begin{itemize}
\item
stage IF (instruction fetch)
\item
stage ID (instruction decode)
\item
stage EX (execution)
\item
stage MEM (memory access)
\item
stage WB (write back)
\end{itemize}
In my design philosophy, each of them should be implemented as a single module.

\subsubsection{Instruction Fetch}
The main function of this module is to generate the program counter and send it to the instruction ROM in order to fetch the current instruction.
\input{table/stage_if}

This module is implemented in \texttt{src/cpu/stage/stage\_if.v}.

\subsubsection{Instruction Decode}
The main function of this module is to decode the instruction and extract the operator, category, operands and destination register from it.
\input{table/stage_id}

In order to mitigate the data hazards, some interfaces are designed to fetch the latest data forwarding from the stage EX and the stage MEM.

After implementing the full bypassing, there is only one kind of data hazard: a load instruction immediately followed by an instruction which has data dependency on it. In this case, we have to enable the "\texttt{stall\_request}" signal in order to stall the pipeline for one cycle.

This module is implemented in \texttt{src/cpu/stage/stage\_id.v}.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Execution}
The main function of this module is to calculate the operation result according to the operator and operands sending from the stage ID.
\input{table/stage_ex}

In order to mitigate the data hazards, some interfaces are designed to fetch the latest data forwarding from the stage MEM and the stage WB.

Note that the "\texttt{stall\_request}" signal is actually redundant because in the functional simulation, all kinds of calculation can be finished in a single cycle.

This module is implemented in \texttt{src/cpu/stage/stage\_ex.v}.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Memory Access}
The main function of this module is to handle the memory access instruction: calculate the effective memory address and send it to the data ROM in order to do the load or store operation.
\input{table/stage_mem}

This module is implemented in \texttt{src/cpu/stage/stage\_mem.v}.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Write Back}
The main function of this module is to generate the register HI and LO and send them to the previous stage in order to extract the operands correctly.
\input{table/stage_wb}

This module is implemented in \texttt{src/cpu/stage/stage\_wb.v}.
